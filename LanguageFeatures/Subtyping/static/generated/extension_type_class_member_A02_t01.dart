/// @assertion We say that a type T0 is a subtype of a type T1 (written
/// T0 <: T1) when:
/// Assume that T1, .. Ts are types, and V resolves to an extension type
/// declaration of the following form:
///
/// extension type V<X1 extends B1, .. Xs extends Bs>(T id) ... {
///   ... // Members.
/// }
/// It is then allowed to use V<T1, .. Tk> as a type.
///
/// @description Check that if type `T0` is an extension type `V` with
/// non-nullable representation type then it is subtype of `Object`
/// @author sgrekhov22@gmail.com

/// @description Check that if type T0 is a subtype of a type T1, then instance
